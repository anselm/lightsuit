I added sample code for a perlin noise filter. This runs on a mac under lib cinder. The idea came from the beyond fire organization that did the tangoed up in blues dome at burning man this year.

I also added the source code for the beaglebone version - which is much faster and raises the ceiling on the kinds of effects I can run.

This is the source code for a lightsuit.

The lights are from CoolNeon in Oakland.

The Seeduino board was used.

Look at http://hook.org for more documentation.
