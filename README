Old notes are here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rPDT2VlaQyghIM7df_HLJ5sXOeLthk5gfbjXlYARHEo/pub

I would recommend using this as a foundation instead now: http://scanlime.org/2014/02/fadecandy-controller-available-from-adafruit/

Also see the Radiance Dome by my friends in Eugene Oregon: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfXwkWLpe30

I added sample code for a perlin noise filter. This runs on a mac under lib cinder. The idea came from the beyond fire organization that did the tangoed up in blues dome at burning man this year.

I also added the source code for the beaglebone version - which is much faster and raises the ceiling on the kinds of effects I can run.

This is the source code for a lightsuit.

The lights are from CoolNeon in Oakland.

The Seeduino board was used.

Look at http://hook.org for more documentation.
